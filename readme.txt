Please check out the following branches in order
1. first_android_app: homework for building a simple Android program with step-by-step guide
2. YO: homework for building YO with step-by-step guide
3. master: complete code for YO app

Current branch: first_android_app

What we're going to do in this branch:
Build a simple version of "YO".
Check out "demo_YO_1.0.gif‚Äù to see what it should like after you have finished all the todos.

How to do it step by step:
Open the project using Android Studio, open the "TODO" tab at the bottom and
follow the order of the TODOs.

Life advice:
If you have any questions, try Google before asking someone else. You need PRACTICE how to get what you want.
If you can not find the answer, feel free to post your question in http://www.jiuzhang.com/qa or QQ group.
You can see the complete code (including code for Challenge) in "master" branch.
But keep in mind, don't check out the code in "master" branch until you have finished everything
all by yourself.
